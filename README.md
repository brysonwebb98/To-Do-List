# Overview

I created this project to improve my JavaScript skills and learn how to make a webpage more dynamic. I have experience in Python, SQL, HTML & CSS, and some JavaScript, so this to-do list helped me focus on interacting with the DOM and handling user input.

The app lets users add tasks, assign categories, filter them, and delete them. I also used the Luxon library to display the current date and time, and I wrote a recursive function to automatically count and number each task when it’s added.

This project helped me practice ES6 features, work with an external library, and build a simple but functional interactive tool.s

# Development Environment

For this project I used Visual Studio Code as my development environment. I wrote the application in JavaScript, along with HTML and CSS to handle the layout and structure of the page. I also included the Luxon library through a CDN link so I could use it directly in the browser without extra setup.

The project runs entirely client-side, using JavaScript to create elements, update the task list, and filter tasks in real time. Building it in VS Code made it easy to test changes quickly and keep my files organized as I worked.

# Future Work

- Improve the CSS layout to support mobile screens and make the interface more user-friendly.
- Add simple visual styling like icons or color coding for categories.
- Save tasks to local storage so they remain after refreshing the page.
